        - text: This option gives you access to space on a shared server. Many sites using the same server means your site speed could be impacted if another is more demanding. Consider this option if you’re just starting out and keeping costs down, but be prepared to upgrade soon.
      - listitem:
        - strong: Virtual private server (VPS).
        - text: Start here if your budget allows. A VPS gives you a dedicated subsection of a server for more storage and bandwidth. You’ll have greater control over the setup of your ecommerce store, and you’ll be less likely to bear the brunt of other sites on a shared server slowing yours down.
      - listitem:
        - strong: Dedicated server.
        - text: With this option, you’re not impacted by demands from other sites. The only website using the server is yours. Prepare to upgrade to this package once you’re serving tens of thousands of visitors each month.
    - paragraph:
      - text: The downside to self-hosting is that it can get expensive—fast. Tiered pricing incentivizes small businesses to spend more for faster loading speeds, prioritized customer support, and increased bandwidth. That’s on top of the other
      - link "website costs":
        - /url: /blog/ecommerce-website-cost
      - text: you’ll need to factor into your ecommerce operating expenses.
    - heading "How to choose an ecommerce hosting provider" [level=2]
    - paragraph: Google the phrase “ecommerce hosting provider” and you’ll see thousands of results. How do you know which company to trust with your website, your most important ecommerce business asset?
    - paragraph: Here are five important things a beginner should consider when choosing a new hosting provider.
    - heading "Pricing" [level=3]
    - paragraph: It makes sense to pay for a top-quality ecommerce host. A reliable one minimizes the chance of your website becoming unavailable for customers to access. But bear in mind that some options can be much cheaper than others in the long term, especially if you plan to scale.
    - paragraph: Check for any limitations or hidden fees on the ecommerce hosting plans you’re comparing. With some self-hosted providers, certain features—such as analytics access, file storage, bandwidth overages, and branded email accounts—cost extra.
    - paragraph:
      - text: Planning to keep costs down? Hosting from your ecommerce platform bundles those costs into one monthly fee.
      - link "Shopify hosting":
        - /url: /tour/ecommerce-hosting
      - text: ", for example, starts at just $29 per month and includes a domain name, unlimited bandwidth, inventory management, and PCI compliance in one dashboard. Paying for each of those ecommerce features separately would be much more expensive."
    - heading "Speed and bandwidth" [level=3]
    - paragraph: The experience a customer has with your website makes or breaks their decision to purchase something.
    - paragraph:
      - text: Just a one-second improvement in
      - link "page load speeds":
        - /url: /blog/site-speed-importance
      - text: can increase mobile conversions by up to 27%. You’ll also improve your
      - link "ecommerce SEO":
        - /url: /blog/ecommerce-seo-beginners-guide
      - text: since site speeds factor in Google’s ranking algorithm. Search engines want to point users toward sites with pleasant experiences.
    - paragraph: For each hosting provider on your shortlist, check the bandwidth—the maximum data a host can transfer between your website and a visitor within a given time period.
    - paragraph: If you exceed your host’s bandwidth limit, your site will become unavailable for potential customers to access. The host can’t process data fast enough to cope with high demand. In this case, you’ll likely need to upgrade your plan—hence why limited bandwidth hosting providers can get more expensive as your ecommerce business scales.
    - paragraph: Narrow your shortlist down to providers with unlimited bandwidth. When your ecommerce business begins to grow, unlimited bandwidth gives you enough processing power to serve thousands of website visitors at once.
    - heading "Uptime" [level=3]
    - paragraph: You lose money every second your ecommerce store is offline. Prevent that from happening by selecting a hosting provider with a history of minimal downtime.
    - paragraph:
      - text: Tools like
      - link "Uptime":
        - /url: https://uptime.com/

      - img "page speed results and uptime percentage per month for a site hosted via GoDaddy"
      - text: Choose a hosting service that supports a high percentage of uptime and a fast site load time.
    - paragraph: Confirm with each provider whether your store is backed up if the worst does happen. Should something go wrong, you’ll have a file to reupload and get your store back online. The frequency of these depends on how often you update your site. Small businesses might only need weekly backups; larger stores with thousands of SKUs will need daily backups.
    - paragraph:
      - text: In addition, check the protection each hosting provider gives its data centers. Top
      - link "web hosting providers":

      - text: have processes in place to prevent downtime, like on-site security, multiple sources of energy, and cooling systems to prevent the servers from overheating.
    - heading "Privacy and security" [level=3]
    - paragraph: Unfortunately, every website owner runs the risk of falling victim to an attack. Criminals can inject malicious code into your data and eavesdrop on information passed through. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) is also common. It happens when scammers overload your host and make your site unavailable.
    - paragraph: "Greatly minimize the risk of attacks tanking your site by choosing a host with antivirus features like:"

      - listitem: Malware scanning
      - listitem: DDoS protection

        - /url: /blog/register-a-domain-name
      - text: . If you’d rather keep this information to yourself, choose a provider that offers WHOIS protection.
    - paragraph: Free SSL certificates are another thing to look out for when evaluating different hosts. An ecommerce store will be marked “Not secure” without an SSL certificate, which encrypts the data being transmitted through a website.
    - figure "Partake's SSL certificate assures visitors that information passed through its ecommerce store is secure.":

      - link "Partake":
        - /url: https://partakefoods.com/
      - text: "'s SSL certificate assures visitors that information passed through its ecommerce store is secure."
    - paragraph:
      - text: Speaking of encrypting data, customers pass sensitive information through a website when making online purchases. Protect their names, mailing addresses, and credit card information by confirming each hosting provider is
      - link "PCI compliant":
        - /url: /security/pci-compliant
      - text: .
    - paragraph: The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) must be followed by all businesses that process online payments. Designed to reduce fraud, your ecommerce hosting provider needs to be PCI compliant in order to take payments like Mastercard, American Express, Visa, and more.
    - paragraph:
      - text: For more protection, combine your cloud hosting provider with services like
      - link "Cloudflare":
        - /url: https://www.cloudflare.com/
      - text: . It acts as the middleman between your host and a user’s browser for an added layer of security.
    - heading "Customer support" [level=3]
    - paragraph: Hosting can be complex, especially as the volume of your website traffic increases. Make sure the ecommerce host you choose is easy to contact if you have questions.
    - paragraph: “Many hosts offer 24/7 customer support, but the level of support can vary greatly,” says Dave Smyth, co-founder of Scruples. “Consider what options there are for contacting a support team. Phone or live chat can be great in an emergency, but sometimes you just need to send a quick ticket about a non-urgent task without waiting in a queue.”
    - paragraph: That’s another important distinction between SaaS and self-hosted platforms. The latter, for which pricing is often tiered, incentivizes you to pay more for priority support.
    - heading "Your choice of ecommerce host is important" [level=2]
    - paragraph: The ecommerce host you choose for your online store is a big decision. Your provider is responsible for making your site accessible to potential customers wherever and whenever they want to shop.
    - paragraph: Take some time to investigate the ecommerce hosting options we’ve recommended here—but don’t rush into it. Many providers offer 30-day money-back guarantees and free trials to test each package.

    - paragraph: Yes, every online store needs an ecommerce host. Your provider relays data—like images, text files, and code—to a visitor’s browser when they land on your website. They’d land on a broken website if you didn’t have a host.
    - heading "What are the three types of ecommerce web hosts?" [level=3]
    - paragraph: "Ecommerce hosting providers give three options: shared hosting (sharing space with other websites on the same data), a virtual private server (a smaller, private section of the shared server), or dedicated servers (you’re the only website using the server)."
    - heading "What is an ecommerce server?" [level=3]
    - paragraph: An ecommerce server is the computer hardware a hosting provider uses to store your website’s data. A shopper’s browser requests information from this server when loading the page.
